433.92-Raspberry-Pi
===================

This is the Android GUI that can be used to control 433.92Mhz devices. It communicates with the 433-daemon from the `lirc` branch.
This is only a proof of concept because i'm not a GUI designer. If people want to rewrite it or start all over, feel free. 
The purpose of this program is just to show what the 433-daemon (and it's JSON api) is capable of.

Just install the DomoticaAndroid.apk file to your phone.

## DISCLAIMER
__This is my very first Android project. It's flaky, badly designed, doesn't work well under the hood, drains battery and resources etc.
Like i said before but can't say enough, it's just a proof of concept. So NO support is given, so don't ask any, but of course, i'm willing to help programmers to built a new proper version.__
